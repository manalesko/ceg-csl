This is a small project for developing a custom CSL style for the Competition Economist Group, used in _Zotero_ bibliography management software.

It is based on the Modern Humanities Research Association's 3rd edition implemented citation style with full notes and bibliography, adjusted to the needs for Competition Economists Group.

Main adjustments include:
* Allow multiple languages
* Display more information for certain document types (i.e., case numbers for cases, full issue date for legal documents)
* Always display Short title for document types used for expert reports and case exhibits
* Display first (full) reference in footnote the same way as in Bibliography
